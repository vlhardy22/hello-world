# hello-world
Basic Hello World repository

I am a QA professional with some coding experience in Java, Javascript, C++ and Python. I used Git, although not Github, at my last
job and found it to be a rather Alice-in-Wonderland like experience because of all the branches and the way they were set up. I am 
hoping Github will be clearer.
